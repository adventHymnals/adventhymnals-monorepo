O strike for vic-to-ry, Sol-diers of the Lord, Hop-ing in His mer-cy, Trust-ing in His word;\nWhat to you the night has been, let now the day be; En-e-mies are march-ing, Foe-men gather strong,\nGird! O gird for bat-tle, Haste to the field, Trust-ing in His pow-er, Je-sus is your shield;\nLong to fight a good fight, Hearb to heart is won, Let us still keep press-ing Till our journey's done."
