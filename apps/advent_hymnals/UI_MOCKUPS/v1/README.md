## Critical Design Gap Identified

⚠️ **Important Missing Screens**: The current mockup set lacks essential navigation screens for a comprehensive hymnal application:

### Missing Core Browse Screens:
- **Authors Browse Screen** - Browse hymns by author (John Newton, Charles Wesley, etc.)
- **Topics Browse Screen** - Browse by theme/topic (Grace, Salvation, Christmas, etc.)
- **Tunes Browse Screen** - Browse by tune name (NEW BRITAIN, AMAZING GRACE, etc.)
- **Meters Browse Screen** - Browse by meter (8.6.8.6 C.M., 8.7.8.7 D, etc.)
- **Scripture Reference Screen** - Browse by biblical references
- **Keys Browse Screen** - Browse by musical key (C Major, F Major, etc.)
- **First Lines Browse Screen** - Browse by first line of hymn
- **Seasonal/Liturgical Screen** - Browse by church season or liturgical calendar

### Missing Secondary Screens:
- **Advanced Search Screen** - Multi-criteria search interface
- **Collections Management** - Add/remove hymnal collections
- **Offline Mode Screen** - Manage offline content
- **Playlist/Favorites Screen** - Manage personal collections
- **Worship Mode Screen** - Projection/display optimized interface
- **Audio Player Screen** - Full-screen media player
- **History Screen** - Recently viewed/searched hymns

### Recommendation:
The next iteration should include mockups for these essential screens to provide a complete user experience for hymnal navigation. These screens are fundamental to how users typically search and browse hymnal content.

## Technical Notes
- All SVG files have been converted to PNG format for broader compatibility
- Files maintain vector scalability while providing raster alternatives
- Color values use hex codes for consistency across platforms
- All interactive elements meet accessibility standards for touch targets

## Version History
- **v1.0** - Initial improved mockups with high-priority UX enhancements
- **v0.0** - Original mockups (parent directory)

## Next Steps
1. Create mockups for missing browse screens (authors, topics, tunes, meters)
2. Design advanced search and filter interfaces
3. Develop worship/projection mode interfaces
4. Create responsive layouts for tablet/desktop views
5. Add dark mode variants for all screens
