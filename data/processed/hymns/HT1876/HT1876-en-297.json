    {"number": 1, "text": "Day of glory, when shall we behold Earth overwhelmed with thy splendor untold? Dark is this desert, and weary our road; Oh! for that day-spring that cometh from God! Deep are earthly shadows, its sorrows and gloom; Oft is its gladness laid low in the tomb. Joys and sufferings, like shadows depart, Griefs and afflictions abide in the heart."},
    {"number": 2, "text": "Many the sorrows this sad earth has known; Hopes have been withered, and hearts have been torn; Tears have been gushing from fountains of grief; Oh, for that morning which brings us relief! Ah, we have tasted of blessings to come; On we have hasted to gain them at home; There, in the light of eternity's morn, Glad shall the saints sing the conquers' song."}
