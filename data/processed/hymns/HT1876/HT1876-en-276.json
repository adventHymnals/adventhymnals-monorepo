    {"number": 1, "text": "Son of God, thy people shield, Must we still thine absence mourn? Let thy promise be fulfilled, Thou hast said, I will return. Gracious Master, soon appear, Take me to thy home of light; Thou wilt close the constant tear, Hope be turned to joyful sight."},
    {"number": 2, "text": "As a woman counts the days Till her absent lord returns, Looks and watches, weeps and prays, So the church must long for thee. Come, that we may see thee such; Thou the sheep shall feed in peace; Hushed forever trouble's sigh, Sin and sorrow ever cease."}
