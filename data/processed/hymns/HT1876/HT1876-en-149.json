    {"number": 2, "text": "He ever lives above, For me to intercede; His all-redeeming love, His precious blood to plead; His blood was shed for all our race, And sprinkles now the throne of grace."},
    {"number": 3, "text": "Five bleeding wounds he bears, Received on Calvary; They pour effectual prayers, They strongly speak for me; Forgive him, oh! forgive, they cry, Nor let the contrite sinner die!"},
    {"number": 4, "text": "The Father hears him pray, His dear, anointed One; He cannot turn away The presence of his Son; His Spirit answers to the blood, And tells me I'm a child of God."},
    {"number": 5, "text": "To God I'm reconciled; His pardoning voice I hear; He owns me for his child; I can no longer fear; With confidence I now draw nigh, And Father, Abba Father, cry."}
