    {"number": 2, "text": "No spot on this earth can give permanent bliss, No bond for the stranger and pilgrim is this; But beyond the bright river, a mansion where I shall dwell, We'll find in the bosom of Jesus a home."},
    {"number": 3, "text": "This hope cheers the prospect that's gloomy and drear, And solace to hearts that are troubled and sear; Oh! there, in sweet bonds of delight we shall roam, And find in the bosom of Jesus a home."}
