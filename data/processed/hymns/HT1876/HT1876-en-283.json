    {"number": 2, "text": "I'd sing the characters he bears, And all the forms of love he wears, Exalted on his throne; In loftiest songs of sweetest praise, I would to everlasting days Make all his glories known."},
    {"number": 3, "text": "Well, the delightful day will come, When my dear Lord will take me home, And I shall see his face; Then, with my Saviour, brother, friend, A blest eternity I'll spend, Triumphant in his grace."}
