    {"number": 1, "text": "When, along life's thorny road, Faints the soul beneath the load; When, by cross and loss oppressed, Worn and weary, seeks for rest; When the wily tempter's near, Filling us with doubt and fear; Jesus, to thy cross we flee; Jesus, we will look to thee."},
    {"number": 2, "text": "Thou, our Saviour, from the throne, Listenest to thy people's moan; Thou, the faithful and the true, Every pang thy members bear, All of tenderness thou art; Thou wilt heal the broken heart; Full of power, thine arm shall quell Every foe that doth rebel."},
    {"number": 3, "text": "Mighty to redeem and save, Thou hast overcome the grave; Thou the bars of death hast riven, Opened wide the gates of heaven; Thou canst break the galling chain, Taking thy poor pilgrims home; Jesus, thou are all and allâ€” Ever, ever, Lord, with thee."}
