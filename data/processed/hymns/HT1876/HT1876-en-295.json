Here is naught but care and mourning; Comes a joy, it will not stay, Fairly shines the sun at dawning, Night will soon o'ercloud the day."},
    {"number": 2, "text": "Onward then! not long I wander Ere my Saviour comes for me; And with him alighting yonder, All his glory I shall see. Oh! what joyful days are before! Oh, the beats redeemed by love! Oh, the hallelujahs ringing Through the halls of light above!"}
