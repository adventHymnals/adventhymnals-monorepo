      "text": "In forty—three, each took his lamp,\nWent forth to meet the Lord;\nAnd nothing then our faith could damp,\nWe lean'd on the sure word.\nHow sweet and cheering was the sound\nThat fell upon our ears\nHow swiftly flew the echo round,\nThe Lord will come this year!"
    },
    {
      "number": 3,
      "text": "But, forty—three flew quickly by\nAnd left us toiling here;\nThen slumber stole upon each eye\nAnd closed each listening ear.\nIn forty—four, we heard a cry\nAt midnight pealing forth—\nBehold, the heavenly Bridegroom's nigh,\nHe'll soon descend to earth."
    },
    {
      "number": 4,
      "text": "It truly was a solemn cry,\nAs ever earth did hear\nLike many waters rushing by,\nIt fell upon the ear.\nEach virgin rose and trimm'd the lamp,\nWith eager haste went out\nFrom north to south, throughout the camp,\nWas heard one mighty shout."
    },
    {
      "number": 5,
      "text": "Each heart with solemn rapture swell'd,\nAs we proclaim'd the cry—\nNor heeded we the scoffs that fell\nFrom many a passer by.\nLike ancient men of Galilee,\nWe gaz'd into the sky,\nDoubtless our Lord we soon should see\nDescending from on high."
    },
    {
      "number": 6,
      "text": "Our longing eyes were rais'd in vain,\nTo meet Him in the air,\nFor 'twas not so, the Bridegroom came,\nHis Bride's not here, but there.\nThere to the fair Jerusalem,\nUnseen by mortal eye,\nJesus our King and Priest did come,\nThus answering to the cry."
    },
    {
      "number": 7,
      "text": "'Tis there, within the pearly gates,\nA marriage feast is spread\n'Twas purchas'd for the scatter'd saints\nBy Christ, their living Head.\nThen let us patient wait awhile,\nTill we those joys do see;\nThere we shall bask beneath his smile\nTo all eternity."
