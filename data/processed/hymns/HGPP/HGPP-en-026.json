      "number": 3,
      "text": "The world will not persecute those who are like them,\nBut hold them the same as their own;\nThe pure testimony cries out separation,\nWhich calls you your lives to lay down;\nCome out from their spirit and practices too;\nThe track of the Saviour keep full in your view,\nThe pure testimony still cut its way through."

      "number": 4,
      "text": "A battle is coming between the two kingdoms,\nThe armies are gathering round;\nThe pure testimony and vile persecution,\nWill come to close battle ere long;\nThen gird on your armor ye saints of the Lord,\nAnd he will direct you by his living word;\nThe pure testimony trill cut like a sword."
