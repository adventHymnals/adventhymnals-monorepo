      "text": "We are going home–we soon shall be\nWhere the skies are clear, and the soil is free;\nWhere the victor's song floats o'er the plains,\nAnd the seraph's anthem blends with its strains;\nWhere the sun rolls down a brilliant flood\nOf beams on a world that's fair and good;\nAnd stars that dimm'd at nature's doom,\nWill sparkle and dance o'er the new earth's bloom.\nO, that beautiful home, &c."

      "text": "Where the tears and sighs which here are given,\nAre exchanged for the gladsome songs of heaven;\nAnd the beauteous forms that sing and shine,\nAre guarded well by a hand divine.\nPure love's banner and friendship's wand\nAre waving above that princely band;\nAnd the glory of God, like a molten sea,\nBathes the immortal company.\nO, that beautiful home, &c."
