      "text": "IT was not sleep that bound my sight,\nUpon that well-remembered night;\nIt was not fancy's fitful power,\nBeguiled me in that solemn hour.\nBut o'er the vision of my soul,\nThe mystic future seemed to roll;\nAnd in the deep, prophetic trance,\nRevealed its treasures to my glance."

      "number": 2,
      "text": "Before my wondering eyes there stood,\nA vast, a countless multitude;\nThe hoary sire, the prattling child,\nThe mother and the maiden mild,\nThe gladsome youth, and man of care—\nAll tribes, all ages, mingled there;\nAnd all, where'er I turned to see,\nIn humble silence bent the knee."

    {
      "number": 3,
      "text": "Still o'er the crowded scene I gazed;\nAgainst the lurid eastern sky,\nI saw the shameful cross upraised;\nI saw the sufferer doomed to die.\n'Twas He whom late with sorrowing mein,\nIn Zion's streets I oft had seen;\nAnd now in blood and agony,\nHe turned a dying look on me."
    },
    {
      "number": 4,
      "text": "Then softly from that gathering throng,\nArose the sound of solemn song;\nAnd while I caught the swelling lay,\nThe myriad voices seemed to say:—\n\"And we believe in him that died,\nBy Pontius Pilate crucified—\nhe shall come, when time is fled,\nTo judge the living and the dead.\""

      "number": 5,
      "text": "I woke—thou wast not by my side,\nI heard a loud exulting cry;\nI heard the scornful priests deride,\nThe elders murmur, \"Crucify!\"\nO Pilate! Hadst thou marked my prayer\nThat guiltless blood to shield and spare,\nThat deed of horror would not be\nA stain to thine—a curse to thee!"

    {
      "number": 6,
      "text": "Our scenes of early love are past;\nOur youthful spring is withered all;\nAfar from Rome our lot is cast,\nBeneath the sunny skies of Gaul;\nThe thoughts that memory treasures yet\nOf other days, begin to flee;\nBut never shall my heart forget\nThe crucified of Galilee!"
