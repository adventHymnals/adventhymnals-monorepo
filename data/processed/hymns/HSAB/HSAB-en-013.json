      "text": "Now the light of truth they're seeking,\nIn its onward track pursue;\nAll the ten commandments keeping,\nThey are holy, just and true.\nOn the words of life they're feeding,\nPrecious to their taste so sweet;\nAll their Master's precepts heeding,\nBowing humbly at his feet."

      "text": "In that world of light and beauty,\nIn that Golden City fair,\nSoon its pearly gates they'll enter,\nAnd of all its glories share.\nThere divine the soul's expansions;\nFree from sin, and death, and pain;\nTears will never dim those mansions\nWhere the saints immortal reign."
