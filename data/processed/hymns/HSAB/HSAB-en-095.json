To God the chorus breaks,\nFrom every host, from every gem,\nBut one alone, the Saviour speaks,\nIt is the Star of Bethlehem."

      "text": "Once on the raging seas I rode,\nThe storm was loud, the night was dark,\nThe ocean yawn'd, and rudely blow'd\nThe wind that toss'd my foundering bark.\nDeep horror then my vitals froze,\nDeath struck–I ceased the tide to stem,\nWhen suddenly a star arose,\nIt was the Star of Bethlehem."
