      "text": "THE pure testimony put forth in the Spirit,\nCuts like a sharp two-edged sword,\nAnd hypocrites now are most sorely tormented,\nBecause they're condemn'd by the Word,\nThe pure testimony discovers the dross,\nWhile wicked professors make light of the cross,\nAnd Babylon trembles for fear of her loss."

      "number": 2,
      "text": "Then blow ye the trumpet in pure testimony,\nAnd let the saints hear it again;\nO come ye from Babylon, Egypt and Sodom,\nAnd make your way over the plain,\nCome, wash all your robes in the blood of the Lamb,\nAnd walk in the Spirit, as Jesus has done,\nIn the pure testimony you will overcome."

    {
      "number": 3,
      "text": "The world will not persecute those who are like them,\nBut hold them the same as their own;\nThe pure testimony cries out separation,\nWhich calls you, your lives to lay down;\nCome out from their spirit and practices too;\nThe track of the Saviour keep full in your view,\nThe pure testimony will cut its way through."
    },
    {
      "number": 4,
      "text": "The battle is coming between the two kingdoms,\nThe armies are gathering round;\nThe pure testimony and vile persecution\nWill come to close battle ere long;\nThen gird on your armor ye saints of the Lord,\nAnd He will direct you by his living word,\nThe pure testimony will cut like a sword."
