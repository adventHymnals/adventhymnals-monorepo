      "text": "While angelic legions with harps tun'd celestial,\nHarmoniously join in the Concert Of praise;\nThe saints, as they flock from the regions terrestrial,\nIn loud hallelujahs their voices will raise.\nThen songs to the Lamb, shall re-echo thro' heaven,\nMy soul will respond, to Immanuel be given,\nAll glory all honor, all might and dominion,\nWho brought us thro' grace to the Eden of Love."

      "number": 3,
      "text": "Then hail, blessed state! Hail, ye songsters of glory,\nYe harpers of bliss, soon I'll meet you above.\nAnd join your full choir in rehearsing the story\nSalvation from sorrow through Jesus' love.\"\nThough prison'd in earth, yet, by anticipation,\nAlready my soul feels a sweet prelibation\nOf joys that await me, when freed from probation\nMy heart is now in heaven, the Eden of Love."
