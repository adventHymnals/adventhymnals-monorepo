      "text": "And one, I saw, with sword and shield;\nWho boldly braved the world's cold frown\nAnd fought, unyielding, on the field,\nTo win an everlasting crown.\nThough worn with toil, oppressed by foes,\nNo murmur from his heart arose;\nI asked, what buoyed his spirits up,\nO, this, said he—the Blessed Hope!"

      "text": "And there was one who left behind,\nThe cherished friends of early years,\nAnd honor, pleasure, wealth resigned\nTo tread the path bedewed with tears.\nThrough trials deep, and conflicts sore,\nYet still a smile of joy he wore;\nI asked, what buoyed his spirits up,\nO, this, said he—the Blessed Hope!"

      "text": "While pilgrims here, we journey on\nIn this dark vale of sin and gloom,\nThrough tribulation, hate and scorn,\nOr through the portals of the tomb;\n'Till our returning King shall come,\nTo take his exiled captives home,\nO, what can buoy the spirits up?\n'Tis this alone—that Blessed Hope!"
