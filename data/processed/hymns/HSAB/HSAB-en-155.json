For why should we prove\nUnfaithful to him who has shown\nSuch deep, such unbounded and infinite loveâ€”\nWho died to redeem us his own."

The City of gold,\nPrepared for the good and the blest,\nIs waiting its portals of pearl to unfold,\nAnd welcome thee into thy rest;\nThen Brother prove faithful! Not long shall we stay,\nIn weariness here and forlorn,\nTime's dark night of sorrow is wearing away,\nWe haste to the glorious morn."

And soon shalt thou hear\nThy Saviour pronounce the glad word,\nWell done faithful servant, thy title is clear,\nTo enter the joy of thy Lord."

Eternity's years\nShall tell of thy faithfulness now,\nWhen bright smiles of gladness shall scatter thy tears,\nAnd a coronet gleam on thy brow.\nO Brother be faithful! The promise is sure;\nThat waits for the faithful and tried;\nTo reign with the ransomed, immortal and pure,\nAnd ever with Jesus abide."
