      "text": "Thy judgments, O Lord, soon in wrath will descend,\nO'erwhelming with terror; the tempest will rend;\nBut firm a foundation, sure refuge I see\nIn the Rock of Salvation, above, cleft for me!\nWith all the redeemed, my glad voice would I raise,\nAnd join in the songs to Immanuel's praise;\nThat at thine appearing I numbered may be,\nThou Rock of Salvation—O, hide me in thee!"
