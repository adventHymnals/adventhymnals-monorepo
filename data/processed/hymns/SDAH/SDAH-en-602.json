He soon will descend,\nCreation's omnipotent King,\nWhile bright smiles of gladness shall scatter thy tears,\nA coronet gleam on thy brow.\nO brother, be faithful! and soon shalt thou hear\nThy Savior pronounce the glad word,\nWell done, faithful servant, thy title is clear,\nTo enter the joy of thy Lord."
