Stretch forth to things eternal\nAnd hasten to the feet of your Redeemer God.\nThough hid from mortal eyes, He dwells in light supernal;\nYet worship Him in humbleness and call Him Lord.\nHis banquet of love awaits you above;\nYet here He grants a foretaste of the feast to come!"

Oh, hear the song victorious,\nThe never-ending anthem sounding through the sky!\nTo mortals is not given to join in strains so glorious;\nYet here on earth we too can sing our praises high!\nHe bought with His blood the ransomed of God;\nTo Him be everlasting power and victory."
