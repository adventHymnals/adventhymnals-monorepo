      "text": "Then to side with truth is noble when we share her wretched crust,\nEre her cause bring fame and profit, and 'tis prosperous to be just;\nThen it is the brave man chooses, while the coward stands aside,\nTill the multitude make virtue of the faith they had denied."

      "text": "By the light of burning martyrs, Christ, Thy bleeding feet we track,\nToiling up new Calvaries ever with the cross that turns not back;\nNew occasions teach new duties, time makes ancient good uncouth;\nThey must upward still and onward who would keep abreast of truth."
