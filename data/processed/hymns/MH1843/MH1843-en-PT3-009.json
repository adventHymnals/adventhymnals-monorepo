    "When the King of kings comes,\nWhen the Lord of lords comes;\nWe shall have a joyful day,\nWhen the King of kings comes:\nGreat Babylon is broken down,\nAnd kingdoms once of great re-\nnown,\nAnd saints now suffering wear the\ncrown,\nWhen the King of kings comes.",
    "When the trump of God calls,\nWhen the last of foes falls;\nWe shall have a joyful day,\nWhen the King of kings comes:\nO, then the saints, raised from the\ndead,\nAre with the living gathered,\nAnd all made like their glorious Head,\nWhen the King of kings comes.",
    "When the foe's distress comes,\nThen the church's \"rest\" comes;\nWe shall have a joyful day,\nWhen the King of kings comes:\nAnd then the new Jerusalem,\nSurpassing all report and fame,\nShines worthy of its Maker's name,\nWhen the King of kings comes.",
    "When the world its course has run,\nWhen the judgment is begun;\nWe shall have a joyful day,\nWhen the King of kings comes:\nTo see the sons of God well known,\nAll spotless to their Father shown,\nAnd Jesus all his brethren own,\nWhen the King of kings comes.",
    "When the Conqueror's hour comes,\nWhen he with great power comes;\nWe shall have a joyful day,\nWhen the King of kings comes:"
