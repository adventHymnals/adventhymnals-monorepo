    "1. Sing, ye redeem'd of the Lord, Your great deliverer\n2. See the fair way his hand hath rais'd; How holy, and how\n3. No rav'ning lion shall destroy, No lurking serpent\n4. A hand divine shall lead you on, Thro' all the blissful\nsing; Pilgrims for Zion's city bound, Be\nplain! Nor shall the simplest trav'lors err, Nor\nwound; Pleasure and safety, peace and praise, Thro'\nroad, Till to the sacred mount you rise, And\njoyful in your King, be joyful in your King.\nask ...... the track in vain, nor ask the track in vain.\nall ...... the path are found, thro'all the path are found.\nsee ...... your smiling God, and see your smiling God."
