    "How pleasant 't is to see\nKindred and friends agree—\nEach in his proper station move,\nAnd each fulfil his part,\nWith sympathizing heart,\nIn all the cares of life and love.",
    "'T is like the ointment shed\nOn Aaron's sacred head—\nDivinely rich, divinely sweet;\nThe oil through all the room\nDiffused a rich perfume,\nRan through his robes, and blest his feet.",
    "Like fruitful showers of rain\nThat water all the plain,\nDescending from the neighboring hills:\nSuch streams of pleasure roll\nThrough every friendly soul,\nWhere love, like heavenly dew, distils."
