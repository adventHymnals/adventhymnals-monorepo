    "Now let us sing the coming fate\nOf mystic Babylon the Great,â€”\nHer doom is drawing near:\nJesus now comes on earth to reign,\nHis cause and people to maintain,\nFor them he 'll soon appear.",
    "Before him flows a fiery stream,\nThe heavens above with lightnings\ngleam,\nA thousand thunders roar;\nA heavenly host with him descends,\nHis voice to all the earth extends,\nHis saints now grieve no more.",
    "Eclipsed by glory so divine,\nSun, moon, and stars refuse to shine,\nThe heavens a burning scroll;\nThe day is broke that has no night;\nEarth, struck with horror at the sight,\nNow quakes from pole to pole.",
    "Angels of light, at his command,\nTen thousand times ten thousand,\nstand,\nWaiting his voice to hear;\nThe fiery cherubs spread their wings,\nThe air with loud hosannas rings,\nWhile all his saints draw near."
