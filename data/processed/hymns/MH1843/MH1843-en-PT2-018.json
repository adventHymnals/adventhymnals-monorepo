    "1. From every stormy wind that blows, From every\nswelling tide of woes, There is a calm, a\nsure retreat, 'Tis found beneath the mercy seat.",
    "2. There is a place where Jesus sheds\nThe oil of gladness on our heads;\nA place than all besides more sweet,\nIt is the blood-bought Mercy Seat.",
    "3. There is a scene where spirits blend,\nWhere friend holds fellowship with friend;\nThough sundered far, by faith they meet\nAround one common Mercy Seat.",
    "4. Ah! whither should we flee for aid,\nWhen tempted, desolate, dismayed?\nOr how the hosts of hell defeat,\nHad suffering saints no Mercy Seat?",
    "5. There, there on angel's wings we soar,\nAnd sin and sense seem all no more;\nThe Lord comes down our souls to greet,\nAnd glory crowns the Mercy Seat.",
    "6. O Let my hand forget her skill,\nMy tongue be silent, cold and still;\nThis bounding heart forget to beat\nIf I forget the Mercy Seat."
