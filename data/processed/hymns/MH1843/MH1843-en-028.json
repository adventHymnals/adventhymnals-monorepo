    "Alas! and did my Savior bleed?\nAnd did my Jesus die?\nWould he devote that sacred head\nFor such a worm as I?",
    "Thy body slain, sweet Jesus, thine,\nAnd bath'd in its own blood,\nWhile all exposed to wrath divine,\nThe glorious Suff'rer stood!",
    "Was it for crimes that I had done,\nHe groaned upon the tree?\nAmazing pity! grace unknown!\nAnd love beyond degree!",
    "Well might the sun in darkness hide,\nAnd shut his glories in,\nWhen Christ the glorious Savior died,\nFor man, the creature's sin.",
    "Thus might I hide my blushing face,\nWhile his dear cross appears,\nDissolve my heart in thankfulness,\nAnd melt mine eyes in tears.",
    "But drops of grief can ne'er repay\nThe debt of love I owe;\nHere, Lord, I give myself away;\n'Tis all that I can do."
