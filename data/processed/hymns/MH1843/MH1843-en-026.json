    "'Tis true, we are but strangers,\nWe sojourn here below;\nAnd countless snares and dangers\nSurround the path we go:\nThough painful and distressing,\nYet there's a rest above;\nAnd onward still we're pressing,\nTo reach that land of love.",
    "How lost was my condition,\nTill Jesus made me whole;\nThere is but one Physician\nCan cure a sin-sick soul;\nNext door to death he found me,\nAnd snatch'd me from the grave,\nTo tell to all around me\nHis wondrous power to save.",
    "The worst of all diseases\nIs light, compared with sin;\nOn every part it seizes,\nBut rages most within:\n'Tis palsy, plague, and fever,\nAnd madness all combined;\nAnd none but a believer,\nThe least relief can find.",
    "From men great skill professing,\nI sought a cure to gain;\nBut this proved more distressing,\nAnd added to my pain.\nSome said that nothing ail'd me,\nSome gave me up for lost;\nThus every refuge failed me,\nAnd all my hopes were cross'd.",
    "At length this great physician,\nHow matchless is his grace!\nAccepted my petition,\nAnd undertook my case;\nFirst gave me sight to view him,\nFor sin mine eyes had seal'd,\nThen bade me look unto him;\nI look'dâ€”and I was heal'd."
