    "While angelic legions with harps tuned celestial, Harmoniously join in the concert of praise,",
    "The saints, as they flock from the regions terrestrial, In loud hallelujah their voices will raise;",
    "Then songs to the Lamb shall re-echo through heaven, My soul will respond, to Immanuel be given",
    "All glory, all honor, all might and dominion, Who brought us through grace to the Eden of love.",
    "Then hail, blessed state! Hail ye songsters of glory! Ye harpers of bliss, soon I'll meet you above!",
    "And join your full choir in rehearsing the story, 'Salvation from sorrow, through Jesus's love!'",
    "Though 'prisoned in earth, yet by anticipation, Already my soul feels a sweet prelibation",
    "Of joys that await me, when freed from probation: My heart's now in heaven, the Eden of love."
