    "Patient th' appointed race to run,\nThis weary world we cast behind;\nFrom strength to strength we travel on,\nThe New Jerusalem to find;\nOur labor this, our only aim,\nTo find the New Jerusalem.",
    "Through thee, who all our sins hast\nborne,\nFreely and graciously forgiven,\nWith songs to Zion we return,\nContending for our native heaven,\nThat palace of our glorious King;\nWe find it nearer while we sing.",
    "Raised by the breath of love divine,\nWe urge our way with strength\nrenewed,\nThe church of the first-born to join;\nWe travel to the mount of God;\nWith joy upon our heads arise,\nAnd meet our Savior in the skies.",
    "I love to behold him arrayed\nWith glory and light from above;\nThe King in his beauty displayed,\nHis beauty of holiest love:"
