    "Thy selected people spare;\nArm our caution'd souls with patience,\nFill our humbled hearts with prayer.",
    "If the chastening rod is sore,\nWith all flesh is now begun,\nIs thy wrath remember mercy;\nMercy first and last be shown.\nPlead thy cause with sword and fire;\nShake us till the curse remove;\nTill thou conq'st the world's desire,\nConquering all with sovereign love.",
    "Every fresh alarming token\nMore confirm the faithful word;\nNature, by thy Lord hath spoken,\nShows thy tabernacle near;\nFrom this national confusion,\nFrom this ruined earth and skies,\nSee the times of restitution,\nSee the new creation rise!",
    "Vanish, then, this world of shadows!\nPass the former things away;\nLord, appear! appear to glad us\nWith the dawn of endless day!\nO conclude this mortal story!\nThrow this universe aside!\nCome, eternal King of glory,\nNow descend and take thy bride!"
