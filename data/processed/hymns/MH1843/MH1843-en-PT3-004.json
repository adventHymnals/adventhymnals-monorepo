    "Arise and shine, O Zion fair,\nBehold, thy light is come,\nThy glorious conquering King is near,\nTo take his exiles home;\nThe trumpet's sounding through the sky\nTo set poor sinners free;\nThe day of wonders now is nigh,\nThe year of jubilee.",
    "Arise, ye nations under ground,\nBefore the Judge appear;\nAll tongues, all languages, shall come,\nTheir final doom to hear.\nKing Jesus on his azure throne,\nTen thousand angels round;\nWhile Gabriel, with his silver trump,\nEchoes the dreadful sound.",
    "The glorious news of gospel grace\nWith sinners now is o'er;\nThe trump in Zion now is still,\nAnd to be blown no moreÂ·\nThe watchmen all have left their walls,\nAnd with their flocks above,\nOn Canaan's happy shore they sing,\nAnd shout redeeming love."
