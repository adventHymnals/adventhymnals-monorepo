    "1. When for eternal worlds we steer, And seas are\nAnd faith is lively exercise, And distant\ncalm, and skies are clear, My soul for joy she claps her wings, And\nloud her lovely sonnet sings, Vain world adieu, vain world adieu; And\nloud her lovely sonnet sings, Vain world adieu.",
    "With cheerful hopes her eyes explore\nThose landmarks on the distant shore,\nThe trees of Life, the pastures sweet,\nThe golden streets, the crystal stream;\nAgain for joy she claps her wings, &c.\nWhen nearer still she draws to land,\nMore eager all her powers expand,\nWith steady helm and free bent sail,\nHer anchor drops within the veil.\nAgain for joy she claps her wings,\nAnd her celestial sonnet sings,\nOn Canaan's shore, &c."
