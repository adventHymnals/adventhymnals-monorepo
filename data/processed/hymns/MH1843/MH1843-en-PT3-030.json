    "Burst, ye emerald gates, and bring\nTo my raptured vision\nAll the ecstatic joys that spring\nRound the bright Elysian!",
    "Lo! we lift our longing eyes;\nBreak, ye intervening skies!\nSons of righteousness, arise!\nOpe the gates of paradise!",
    "Floods of everlasting light\nFreely flash before him;\nMyriads, with supreme delight,\nInstantly adore him;\nAngels' trumps resound his fame;\nLutes of lucid gold proclaim\nAll the music of his name,\nHeaven echoing the theme.",
    "Four and twenty elders rise\nFrom their princely station;\nShout his glorious victories,\nSing his great salvation;\nCast their crowns before his throne;\nCry, in reverential tone,\nGlory be to God alone,\nHoly, holy, holy One!",
    "Hark! the thrilling symphonies\nSeem, methinks, to seize us;\nJoin we to the holy laysâ€”\nJesus! Jesus! Jesus!\nSweetest sound in seraphs' song;\nSweetest note on mortals' tongue;\nSweetest carol ever sung:\nJesus! Jesus! flow along."
  ],
  "chorus": "O, how good it is to be blest,\nAnd dwell where loving Jesus is!",
