    "1. Oh! the amazing pomp Of that tremendous day,\nWhen the archangel's trump, Shall summon us away;\nWhen Christ to judgment shall descend, And every knee before him bend.",
    "2. On a refulgent cloud,\nJesus, the Judge, appears;\nThe saints rejoice aloud,\nThe guilty sinner fears.\nOn the white throne he takes his seat,\nAnd views the myriads at his feet.",
    "3. 'Midst the vast multitude,\nHis eye omniscient sees\nThe purchase of his blood\nAnd dying agonies:\nThen calls them forth and bids them stand\nWith glory crown'd at his right hand.",
    "4. \"Come, souls forever blest,\"\nHe says, \"my people come,\nPossess the promised rest,\nEnter your heavenly home;\nNo more shall aught your peace annoy,\nInherit everlasting joy.\"",
    "5. But in what awful sounds\nThe wicked are addressed!\nHeaven with their groans resounds,\nAs on his left they're placed:\n\"Depart ye curs'd the Judge exclaims,\n\"To be destroyed in burning flames!\"",
    "6. Oh! thou eternal God,\nSave in tremendous day,\nCleanse me in Jesus' blood,\nWash all my guilt away.\nThen may I join the happy throng,\nTo praise thee in eternal song."
