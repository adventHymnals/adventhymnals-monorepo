    "Leader of faithful souls, and guide\nOf all that travel to the sky,\nCome, and with us, e'en us, abide,\nWho would on thee alone rely;\nOn thee alone our spirits stay,\nWhile held in life's uneven way.",
    "Strangers and pilgrims here below,\nThis earth, we know, is not our place;\nBut hasten through the vale of wo,\nAnd restless to behold thy face,\nSwift to our heavenly country move,\nOur everlasting home above.",
    "We have no 'biding city here,\nBut seek a city out of sight;\nThither our steady course we steer,\nAspiring to the plains of light,\nJerusalem, the saints' abode,\nWhose founder is the living God."
