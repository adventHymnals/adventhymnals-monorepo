  "verses": [
    "1. How happy is the man, Who has chosen wisdom's ways,\nAnd measured out his span To his God in prayer and praise. His\nGod and his Bible Are all that he desires; To\nbe at ease of heart and life he constantly aspires; In\npoverty he's happy, For he knows he has a friend Who\nnever will forsake him, And on whom he can depend.",
    "2. He rises in the morning,\nWith the lark he tunes his lays,\nAnd offers up a tribute\nTo his God in prayer and praise;\nAnd then unto his labor\nHe cheerfully repairs,\nIn confidence believing\nHis God will hear his prayers.\nWhatever he engages in,\nAt home or far abroad,\nHis object is to honor\nAnd to glorify his God.",
    "3. In sickness, pain and sorrow\nHe never will repine,\nWhile he is drawing nourishment\nFrom Christ the living vine.\nWhen trouble presses heavily,\nHe leans on Jesus' breast,\nAnd in his precious promises\nHe finds a quiet rest.\nThe yoke of Christ is easy,\nThe burden always light;\nThey never make him weary\nWhile Canaan is in sight.",
    "4. 'Tis thus you have his history\nThrough life from day to day;\nReligion is no mystery,\nIt is a beaten way;\nAnd when upon his pillow\nHe lays him down to die,\nHis soul in hope rejoices,\nFor he knows his God is nigh.\nAnd when life's lamp is flickering,\nHis soul on wings of love\nFlies away to realms of glory,\nTo dwell with Christ above.",
    "5. Then he'll be forever happy,\nFor he's joined the holy band,\nHe's received the crown of glory\nAnd a palm is in his hand;\nWith saints and priests and prophets,\nHe'll strike the golden lyre,\nAnd shout loud hallelujahs\nWith all the heavenly choir.\nHe's happy now eternally,\nHis joys are all complete,\nWith his angels he is bowing\nAround the Savior's feet."
