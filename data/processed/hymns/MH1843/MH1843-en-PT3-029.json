    "I long to behold him arrayed\nWith glory and light from above;\nThe King in his beauty displayed,\nHis beauty of holiest love:",
    "I languish and sigh to be there,\nWhere Jesus hath fixed his abode;\nO, when shall we meet in the air,\nAnd fly to the mountain of God?",
    "With him I on Sion shall stand,—\nFor Jesus has spoken the word,—\nThe breeze of Immanuel's land\nSurvey by the light of my Lord.\nBut when, on thy bosom reclined,\nThy face I am strengthened to see,\nMy fulness of rapture I find,\nMy heaven of heavens, in thee.",
    "How happy the people that dwell\nSecure in the city above!\nNo pain the inhabitants feel,\nNo sickness or sorrow shall prove;\nPhysician of souls, unto me\nForgiveness and holiness give,\nAnd then from the body set free,\nAnd then to the city receive."
