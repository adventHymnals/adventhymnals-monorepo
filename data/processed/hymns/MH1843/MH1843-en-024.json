    "There is a home for weary souls,\nBy sin and sorrow driven;\nWhen tossed on life's tempestuous shoals,\nWhere storms arise and ocean rolls\nAnd all is drear—but heaven.",
    "There faith lifts up the tearless eye,\nTo brighter prospects given;\nIt views the tempest passing by,\nSees evening shadows quickly fly,\nAnd all serene—in heaven.",
    "There fragrant flowers immortal bloom,\nAnd joys supreme are given;\nThere rays divine disperse the gloom—\nBeyond the dark, the narrow tomb\nAppears the dawn of heaven.",
    "This world is all a fleeting show,\nFor man's probation given;\nThe smiles of joy, the tears of wo,\nDeceitful shine, deceitful flow;\nThere's nothing true as heaven.",
    "Poor wanderers of a stormy day,\nFrom wave to wave we're driven;\nAnd fancy's flash, and reason's ray\nServe but to light us on the way;\nThere's nothing bright as heaven.",
    "And where's the hand held out to cheer\nThe heart with anguish riven?\nFor sorrow's sigh, and trouble's tear,\nHave never found a refuge here;\nThere's nothing kind as heaven.",
    "In vain do mortals sigh for bliss,\nWithout their sins forgiven:\nTrue pleasure, everlasting peace,\nAre only found in God's free grace;\nThere's nothing good as heaven.",
    "From those who walk in wisdom's way,\nCorroding fears are driven;\nThey're wash'd in Christ's atoning blood,\nEnjoy communion with their God,\nAnd find their way to heaven."
