    "Glorious things of thee are spoken,\nZion, city of our God!\nHe whose word cannot be broken,\nFormed thee for his own abode.\nOn the Rock of Ages founded,\nWhat can shake thy sure repose?\nWith salvation's walls surrounded,\nThou mayest smile at all thy foes.",
    "See! the streams of living waters,\nSpringing from eternal love,\nWell supply thy sons and daughters,\nAnd all fear of want remove.\nWho can faint while such a river\nEver flows their thirst t' assuage?\nGrace, which like the Lord, the giver,\nNever fails from age to age?",
    "Blest inhabitants of Zion,\nWashed in the Redeemer's blood!\nJesus, whom their souls rely on,\nMakes them kings and priests to God:\n'T is his love his people raises\nOver self to reign as kings;\nAnd as priests, his solemn praises\nEach for a thank-offering brings.",
    "Savior, if of Zion's city\nI, through grace, a member am,\nLet the world deride or pity,\nI will glory in thy name.\nFading is the worldling's pleasure,\nAll his boasted pomp and show;\nSolid joys and lasting treasure\nNone but Zion's children know."
