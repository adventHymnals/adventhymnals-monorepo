    "His kingdom still increasing,\nA kingdom without end;\nThe tide of time shall never\nHis covenant remove;\nHis name shall stand forever;\nThat name to us is—Love.",
    "The Savior comes, by ancient bards\nforetold;\nHear him, ye deaf, and all ye blind,\nbehold!\n'T is he the obstructed paths of sound\nshall clear,\nAnd bid new music charm th' unfold-\ning ear.",
    "No more shall nation against nation\nrise,\nNor ardent warriors meet with hate-\nful eyes,\nNo fields with gleaming steel be cov-\nered o'er,\nThe brazen trumpets kindle rage no\nmore.",
    "The lambs with wolves shall graze\nthe verdant mead,\nAnd boys in flowery bands the tiger\nlead;\nThe steer and lion at one crib shall\nmeet,\nAnd harmless serpents lick the pil-\ngrim's feet.",
    "Rise, crowned with light, imperial\nSalem, rise!\nExalt thy towery head, and lift thy\neyes!\nSee barbarous nations at thy gates\nattend,\nWalk in thy light, and in thy temple\nbend.",
    "The seas shall waste, the skies in\nsmoke decay,\nRocks fall to dust, and mountains\nmelt away;\nBut fixed his word, his saving power\nremains,\nThy realm forever lasts—Messiah\nreigns."
