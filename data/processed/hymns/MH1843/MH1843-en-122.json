    "O, tell me, thou life and delight of my soul,\nWhere the flock of thy pasture are feeding;\nI seek thy protection, I need thy control;\nI would go where my Shepherd is leading;",
    "O, tell me the place where thy flock are at rest,\nWhere the noontide will find them reposing;\nThe tempest now rages, my soul is distressed,\nAnd the darkness around me is closing.",
    "O, why must I dwell with the hosts of thy foes,\n'Mid the desert where now they are roving,\nWhere hunger and thirst, where afflictions and woes,\nAnd lies now their ruin are proving?\nO, when shall my exile and wanderings cease,\nAnd the troubles that fill me with weeping?"
