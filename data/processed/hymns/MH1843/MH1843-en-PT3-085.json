    "text": "Savior, we would hear Thee, Follow, find, and see; So, when breaks the vision of that kingdom fair, Lord, so be the increase, peace-able but sure, So shall all God's children from the east and west, Eager hearts arrive there on the pilgrim's road. And in life's adventure Thy disciples be. Ours shall be its riches And its beauty rare. Or Thy word with us, And Thy kingdom's power. Gather to that glorious In its shadow rest. Hail! the kingdom glorious Of the living God!"
