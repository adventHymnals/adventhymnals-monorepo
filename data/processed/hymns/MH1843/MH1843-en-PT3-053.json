Thy beautiful lamp shineth bright o'er my way, Thy glorious light unto Thy perfect day. Through valleys of green, My Shepherd, I follow Thee."

Ah! life that was given, near to my soul, Ah! heart that was broken to make sinners whole. This thrill at Thy marvelous love unto Thy sheep, The way Thou dost lead to the still waters deep. One pastures serene, My Shepherd, I follow Thee."

Thy world is but loss In view of Thy cross, My Shepherd, I follow Thee. One staff and one rod, One fold and one God; My Shepherd, I follow Thee."
