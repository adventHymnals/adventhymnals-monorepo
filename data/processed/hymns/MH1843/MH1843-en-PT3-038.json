    "Hail to the Lord's anointed!\nGreat David's greater Son;\nHail in the time appointed,\nHis reign on earth begun!\nHe comes to break oppression,\nTo set the captive free;\nTo take away transgression,\nAnd rule in equity.",
    "He comes with succor speedy,\nTo those who suffer wrong;\nTo help the poor and needy,\nAnd bid the weak be strong;\nTo give them songs for sighing,\nTheir darkness turn to light,\nWhose souls, condemned and dying\nWere precious in his sight.",
    "He shall come down, like showers\nUpon the fruitful earth,\nAnd love and joy, like flowers,\nSpring in his path to birth;\nBefore him, on the mountains,\nShall peace, the herald, go,\nAnd righteousness in fountains\nFrom hill to valley flow.",
    "For him shall prayer unceasing\nAnd daily vows ascend;"
