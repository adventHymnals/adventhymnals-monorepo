    "A city appears to our view,\nWhere pilgrims will ever reside;\nIf faithful they prove, and are true,\nWill dwell with the Lamb as his\nbride.\nFrom heaven this city descends,\nAbove the ethereal blue;\nThe saints will inhabit it, when\nTo earth they have all bade adieu.",
    "No sun shall illumine that land,\nNor stars in its galaxy shine;\nBut order and harmony grand\nWill be in each portion sublime.\nNo darkness shall ever prevail,\nBut light inexpressible reign;\nNo demon our rights shall assail,\nTo mar in that heavenly plain.",
    "The walls of this city are high,\nHer light's like a jasper most clear;\nWhen she falls from the azure blue\nsky,\nShe will dwell with the holy who\nfear.\nIts streets are pellucid, fine gold;\nNo temple, but God and the Lamb,\nOur eyes shall there ever behold,\nFor they are the light of that land."
