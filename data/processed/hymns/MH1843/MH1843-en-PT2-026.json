    "1. In expectation sweet, We'll wait, and sing, and pray, Till\nChrist's triumphal car we meet, And see an endless day.",
    "2. He comes! the Conqueror comes!\nDeath falls beneath his sword;\nThe joyful prisoners burst the tombs\nAnd rise to meet their Lord.",
    "3. The trumpet sounds, \"Awake!\nYe dead, to judgment come!\"\nThe pillars of creation shake,\nWhile man receives his doom.",
    "4. Thrice happy morn for those\nWho love the ways of peace;\nNo night of sorrow e'er shall close,\nOr shade their perfect bliss."
