    "clouded, I'll bathe in the o-cean of pleasure un-bound-ed,",
    "And range with de-light thro' the E-den of Love.",
    "While angelic legions, with harps tuned celestial,\nHarmonious join in the concert of praise,\nThe saints, as they flock from the regions terrestrial,\nIn loud hallelujahs their voices will raise:\nThen songs to the Lamb shall re-echo thro' heaven,\nMy soul will respond, To Immanuel be given\nAll glory, all honor, all might and dominion,\nWho brought us thro' grace to the Eden of Love.",
    "Then hail, blessed state! hail, ye songsters of glory!\nYe harpers of bliss, soon I'll meet you above!\nAnd join your full choir in rehearsing the story,\n\"Salvation from sorrow, through Jesus' love:\"\nThough 'prisoned in earth, yet by anticipation,\nAlready my soul feels a sweet prelibation\nOf joys that await me, when freed from probation:\nMy heart's now in Heaven, the Eden of Love."
