    "1. And will the Judge descend? And must the dead arise?\nAnd not a single soul escape His all discerning eyes! His all discerning eyes!",

    "3. But ere the trumpet shakes\nThe mansions of the dead,\nHark! from the gospel's cheering sound\nWhat joyful tidings spread!",
    "4. Ye sinners, see his grace,\nWhose wrath ye cannot bear;\nFlee to the shelter of his cross,\nAnd find salvation there"
