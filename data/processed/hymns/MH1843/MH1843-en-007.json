    "I would not live alway; I ask not to stay,\nI would not live alway: Noâ€”welcome the tomb,",
    "Where storm af-ter storm ris-es o'er the dark way\nSlee-p Je-sus has trod there, I dread not its gloom.",
    "The few lu-cid mornings that dawn on us here,\nThere, sweet be my rest, till he bid me a-rise,",
    "Are enough for life's woes, full enough for its cheer.\nTo hail him in triumph de-scend-ing the skies.",
    "Who, who would live alway, away from his God?\nAway from yon heaven, that blissful abode,\nWhere rivers of pleasure flow o'er the bright plains,\nAnd the noon-tide of glory eternally reigns;",
    "Where saints of all ages in harmony meet,\nTheir Savior and brethren, transported to greet;\nWhere anthems of rapture unceasingly roll,\nAnd the smile of the Lord is the feast of the soul."
