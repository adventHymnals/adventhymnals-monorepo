    "Another weary day is past,\nI'm waiting still for thee;\nO, keep me, Savior, till the last,\nAnd set my spirit free.\nI long to know thee as thou art,\nAnd reign with thee in life;\nO, let this longing, fainting heart\nNow end the mortal strife.",
    "With thine immortal image seal\nThis feeble creature thine;\nAnd all thy glory then reveal,\nAnd let me in it shine.\nI would be where thou art: O come!\nNo longer now delay;\nBut take thy weeping children home,\nFrom sin and grief away."
