    "Thy kingdom come! thus, day by\nday\nWe lift our hands to God and pray;\nBut who has ever duly weighed\nThe meaning of the words he said?",
    "Thy kingdom come! O day of joy,\nWhen praise shall every tongue em-\nploy;\nWhen hatred, strife and battles cease\nAnd man with man shall be at peace.",
    "Then bears and wolves, no longer\nwild,\nObey the leading of a child;\nThe lions with the oxen eat,\nAnd dust shall be the serpent's meat",
    "Then all shall know and serve the\nLord,\nAnd walk according to his word;\nHis glory spread around shall be,\nAs waters cover o'er the sea.",
    "God's holy will shall then be done\nBy all who live beneath the sun;\nAnd every evil will remove,\nFor God will reign, and \"God is love.\""
