    "Watchmen! onward to your stations!\nBlow the trumpet long and loud!\nPreach the gospel to the nations,\nSpeak to every gathering crowd!\nSee! the day is breaking!\nSee the saints awaking,\nNo more in sadness bowed!",
    "Watchmen! hail the rising glory\nOf the great Messiah's reign!\nTell the coming Savior's story,\nTell it to the listening train:\nSee his wrath revealing;\nSee the Spirit sealing;\n'T is life amid the slain!",
    "Watchmen! as the clouds are flying,\nAs the doves in haste return,\nThousands, from amid the dying,\nFlee to Christ, his love to learn;\nAll their sighs and sadness\nTurn to joy and gladness,\nWhen they this truth discern."
