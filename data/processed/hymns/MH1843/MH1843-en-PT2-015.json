    "1. My soul is happy when I hear,\nThe Savior is so nigh,\nAnd longs to see his sign appear\nUp on the op'ning sky.",
    "2. I love to wait, and watch, and pray,\nAnd trust his living Word,\nAnd feel the coming of that day\nNo longer is deferr'd.",
    "3. I do rejoice that life was given\nIn these last days to me,\nThat deathless I may rise to heaven,\nAnd my Redeemer see.",
    "4. Then, waiting brethren, let us sing,\nHe will not tarry long;\nAnd fill with love the hours that bring\nThe glory of our song.",
    "5. Yes, he will come, no longer fear,\nThough earth and hell assail;\nHis Word attests the moment near,\nAnd that can never fail."
