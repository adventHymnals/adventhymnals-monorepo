    "O turn ye, O turn ye, for why will you die,\nWhen God in great mercy is coming so nigh?\nNow Jesus invites you, the Spirit says, Come,\nAnd angels are waiting to welcome you home.",
    "How vain the delusion, that while you delay,\nYour hearts may grow better by staying away;\nCome wretched, come starving, come just as you be\nWhile streams of salvation are flowing so free.",
    "And now Christ is ready your souls to receive,\nO how can you question, if you will believe?\nIf sin is your burden, why will you not come?\n'Tis you he bids welcome; he bids you come home.",
    "In riches, in pleasures, what can you obtain,\nTo soothe your affliction, or banish your pain?\nTo bear up your spirit when summon'd to die,\nOr waft you to mansions of glory on high?",
    "Why will you be starving and feeding on air?\nThere's mercy in Jesus, enough and to spare;\nIf still you are doubting, make trial and see,\nAnd prove that his mercy is boundless and free.",
    "Come,give us your hand,and the Savior your heart,\nAnd trusting in Heaven, we never shall part;\nO how can we leave you? why will you not come?\nWe'll journey together, and soon be at home."
