    "Jesus shall reign where'er the sun\nDoes his successive journeys run;\nHis kingdom stretch from shore to\nshore\nTill moons shall wax and wane no\nmore.",
    "To him shall endless prayers be made,\nAnd praises throng to crown his head;\nHis name, like sweet perfume shall\nrise\nWith every daily sacrifice.",
    "Blessings abound where'er he reigns;\nThe prisoner leaps to loose his chains;\nThe weary find eternal rest,\nAnd all the sons of want are blessed.",
    "Where he displays his healing power,\nThe sting of death is known no more;\nIn him the sons of Adam boast\nMore blessings than their father lost."
