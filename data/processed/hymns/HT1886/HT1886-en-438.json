At the throne of faith I entered In, And to him confessed my guilt and sin;
Tho' my heart was all I had to give, Yet he smiled and bade me live alive;
I will sing his praises over death tosave, I will sing beyond the grave."

With his own dear hand he washed me clean, He washed me white as snow.
What a fountain, sweet and pure I've! He washed me white as snow.
I will sing beyond death's chilling wave, 'He washed me white as snow.'"
