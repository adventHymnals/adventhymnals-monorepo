# Google Search Console Submission Guide

This guide explains how to submit your Advent Hymnals website to Google Search Console for better search engine visibility.

## Prerequisites

- Your website must be live and accessible
- You need a Google account
- Access to your website's files or DNS settings

## Step 1: Access Google Search Console

1. Go to [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Click "Add a property"

## Step 2: Choose Property Type

You can add your property in two ways:

### Option A: Domain Property (Recommended)
- Enter your domain: `adventhymnals.org`
- This covers all subdomains and protocols (http/https)
- Requires DNS verification

### Option B: URL Prefix Property
- Enter your full URL: `https://adventhymnals.org`
- Only covers the exact URL entered
- Multiple verification methods available

## Step 3: Verify Ownership

### Method 1: HTML File Upload (Easiest for developers)

1. Download the verification file provided by Google
2. Upload it to your website's root directory
3. Make sure it's accessible at: `https://adventhymnals.org/google[code].html`
4. Click "Verify" in Search Console

### Method 2: HTML Meta Tag (Already Implemented)

The website already includes the verification meta tag in the layout:

```html
<meta name="google-site-verification" content="[YOUR_VERIFICATION_CODE]" />
```

To use this method:
1. Get your verification code from Google Search Console
2. Add it to your environment variables:
   ```bash
   GOOGLE_VERIFICATION=your-verification-code-here
   ```
3. Redeploy your application
4. Click "Verify" in Search Console

### Method 3: DNS Record (For domain property)

1. Add a TXT record to your domain's DNS:
   ```
   Name: @
   Type: TXT  
   Value: google-site-verification=[verification-code]
   ```
2. Wait for DNS propagation (up to 24 hours)
3. Click "Verify" in Search Console

## Step 4: Submit Your Sitemap

Once verified, submit your sitemap for better indexing:

1. In Search Console, go to "Sitemaps" in the left menu
2. Enter your sitemap URL: `https://adventhymnals.org/sitemap.xml`
3. Click "Submit"

The website automatically generates a sitemap at `/api/sitemap`.

## Step 5: Monitor Your Website

## Step 6: Request Indexing (Optional)

For faster indexing of new content:

1. Go to "URL Inspection" in Search Console
2. Enter the URL you want indexed
3. Click "Request Indexing" if the page isn't already indexed
